• Contractual security standards: Integration of binding cybersecurity requirements into all supplier and partner contracts with enforcement mechanisms.

🔗 Strategic Supply Chain Security Framework:
• Risk-based vendor segmentation: Classification of all third parties by criticality and risk potential for prioritized resource allocation.
• Due diligence intensification: Extended cybersecurity assessments before contract conclusion with continuous re-evaluation of existing partners.
• Shared security standards: Development of common cybersecurity standards with key partners for ecosystem-wide resilience.
• Supply chain resilience planning: Building backup suppliers and contingency plans for critical services in case of cybersecurity incidents.

🛡️ ADVISORI's Third-Party Risk Management Approach:
• Automated vendor risk assessment: Implementation of continuous, automated assessment systems for the cybersecurity positioning of all relevant third parties.
• Collaborative security programs: Development of partnership programs that incentivize joint cybersecurity investments and improvements.
• Digital supply chain mapping: Complete visualization and analysis of all digital dependencies and risk paths in the extended enterprise ecosystem.`
