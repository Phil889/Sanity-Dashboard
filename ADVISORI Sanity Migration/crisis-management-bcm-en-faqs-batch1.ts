When assembling, pay attention to a balanced mix of analytical thinkers, pragmatic decision-makers, and strong communicators. Don't forget the human factor: crisis management is emotionally and physically demanding – therefore implement rotation and support systems to prevent exhaustion and maintain team performance even in prolonged crises."

    question: "What are best practices in crisis communication?",
    answer: "🎯 Strategy and Preparation:\n• Development of a comprehensive crisis communication strategy as an integral part of crisis management.\n• Preparation of communication templates and message building blocks for various crisis scenarios.\n• Definition of clear communication objectives, principles, and priorities for crisis situations.\n• Establishment of a multi-level approval process for external communication at different escalation levels.\n• Identification and prioritization of relevant stakeholder groups with specific communication requirements.\n\n👤 Roles and Responsibilities:\n• Appointment and training of dedicated crisis communication managers and spokespersons.\n• Clear definition of communication roles and authorities in the crisis management team.\n• Establishment of functioning interface management between crisis team and communications department.\n• Ensuring deputy arrangements for all communication-relevant positions.\n• Integration of external communication experts into the extended crisis team when needed.\n\n📱 Channels and Methods:\n• Building a diversified communication mix with various crisis-proof channels.\n• Preparation of alternative communication paths in case of primary infrastructure failure.\n• Establishment of effective internal communication processes to inform all employees.\n• Development of channel-specific communication approaches for traditional and social media.\n• Implementation of real-time monitoring systems for media and social media reactions.\n\n💬 Content and Messages:\n• Application of basic principles of transparency, honesty, and empathy in crisis communication.\n• Development of clear, consistent, and fact-based core messages for different target groups.\n• Consideration of legal, regulatory, and reputation-related aspects in communication.\n• Ensuring an appropriate balance between speed and precision of information.\n• Preparation for the three core questions of every crisis: What happened? What are you doing about it? What does this mean for us?\n\n⏱️ Timing and Dynamics:\n• Establishment of a proactive communication approach with regular, timely updates.\n• Implementation of an escalation model with defined communication thresholds and frequencies.\n• Adaptation of communication strategy to different phases of a crisis (outbreak, management, follow-up).\n• Development of processes for rapid approval and distribution of critical information.\n• Consideration of different time zones and cultural contexts in international crises.\n\n💡 Expert Tip:\nIn crisis communication: The first reaction significantly shapes public perception of the entire crisis management. Therefore, prepare standardized initial statements that can be quickly adapted to the situation and inform the most important stakeholders promptly – even if not all facts are known yet. A particularly critical aspect is the speed of social media communication, which often overwhelms traditional approval processes. Therefore develop crisis-proof, lean approval processes and practice them regularly. Don't forget: In a crisis, you communicate not only with words but also through actions – consistency between messages and actual measures is crucial for your credibility."
