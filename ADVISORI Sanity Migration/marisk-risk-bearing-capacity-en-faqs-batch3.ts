    question: 'What specific challenges arise when implementing MaRisk Risk Bearing Capacity systems in complex banking groups with different subsidiaries and how does ADVISORI solve these through integrated governance approaches?',
    answer: `The implementation of MaRisk Risk Bearing Capacity systems in complex banking groups with different subsidiaries presents multidimensional challenges through different business models, regulatory requirements, technology landscapes, and organizational structures. Successful group-wide risk bearing capacity integration requires sophisticated governance approaches that balance local autonomy with central steering while ensuring operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and strategic coherence. ADVISORI develops tailored multi-entity frameworks that navigate complex organizational structures and create sustainable risk bearing capacity excellence.

🏢 Multi-Entity Challenges and Complexities:
• Governance Complexity: Different subsidiaries with different business models, risk profiles, and local requirements require flexible governance structures that connect central standards with local adaptability.
• Regulatory Heterogeneity: Multiple jurisdictions with different MaRisk interpretations, local additional requirements, and different supervisory authorities create complex compliance landscapes for unified risk bearing capacity systems.
• Technology Integration: Legacy systems, different IT architectures, and different data standards in different subsidiaries complicate seamless risk bearing capacity integration and central monitoring.
• Cultural Diversity: Different corporate cultures, working methods, and risk cultures in different entities require sensitive change management approaches for successful transformation.
• Resource Allocation: Optimal distribution of implementation resources, expertise, and budgets between different subsidiaries for efficient group-wide implementation.

🎯 ADVISORI's Integrated Multi-Entity Governance Strategy:
• Federated Governance Model: Development of governance structures that enable central oversight while respecting local autonomy and business-specific requirements.
• Standardized Core with Local Flexibility: Definition of mandatory core standards with flexibility for local adaptations and regulatory requirements.
• Shared Services Approach: Establishment of shared services for common risk bearing capacity functions to optimize resources and ensure consistency.
• Clear Escalation Paths: Definition of clear escalation paths and decision-making authorities for efficient issue resolution across entities.`
