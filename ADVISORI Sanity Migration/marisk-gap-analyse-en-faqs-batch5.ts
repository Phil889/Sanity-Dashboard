    question: 'How can a MaRisk gap analysis be harmonized with requirements from other regulations such as CRR, DORA or NIS2?',
    answer: `The increasing complexity of regulation requires an integrated approach to fulfilling various regulatory requirements. An isolated consideration of MaRisk without considering other relevant regulations such as CRR, DORA or NIS2 leads to inefficient processes and potential compliance gaps. ADVISORI supports harmonized analysis and implementation.

🔄 Integrated Analysis Approach:
• Regulatory overlap analysis: Systematic identification of interfaces and overlaps between MaRisk and other relevant regulations (CRR, DORA, NIS2, BAIT, etc.).
• Common requirements landscape: Development of a consolidated overview of all regulatory requirements to identify synergies and potential conflicts.
• Prioritization by regulatory impact: Assessment of identified gaps by their relevance for different regulations to enable efficient resource allocation.
• Integrated compliance roadmap: Development of a harmonized implementation plan that coherently addresses the requirements of different regulations.

📋 Harmonization Potentials by Topic Areas:
• Governance and organizational structures: Consolidated analysis of governance requirements from different regulations and development of integrated structures.
• IT risk management: Harmonized consideration of IT-related requirements from MaRisk, DORA, NIS2 and BAIT for holistic IT risk management.
• Outsourcing and third-party risks: Integrated analysis of outsourcing requirements from different regulatory sources.
• Emergency management and resilience: Consolidated consideration of requirements for business continuity and operational resilience.

⚡ ADVISORI Methodology for Regulatory Harmonization:
• Cross-regulatory impact assessment: Assessment of the effects of different regulations on business processes, systems and organizational structures.
• Integrated control framework: Development of a consolidated control framework that efficiently covers multiple regulatory requirements.

    question: 'What specific benefits does a MaRisk gap analysis offer for international financial institutions with complex group structures?',
    answer: `International financial institutions with complex group structures face particular challenges in MaRisk compliance. The harmonization of different national regulatory requirements, consistent implementation across different legal entities and efficient management at group level require a specialized approach for gap analysis. ADVISORI offers tailored support for these specific requirements.

🌐 Specific Challenges of International Group Structures:
• Multi-jurisdictional compliance: Necessity to comply with different regulatory requirements in different countries while ensuring consistent group management.
• Complex organizational structures: Challenges in implementing consistent governance and control structures across different legal entities and business areas.
• Data aggregation and consistency: Difficulties in timely and consistent aggregation of risk data across different systems, legal entities and regions.
• Scalability and proportionality: Necessity to establish group-wide standards that simultaneously meet proportionality requirements for differently sized and complex group entities.

🔍 ADVISORI Approach for International Financial Groups:
• Group governance assessment: Comprehensive analysis of group governance structures and their suitability for ensuring effective group-wide MaRisk compliance.
• Multi-entity gap analysis: Coordinated execution of gap analyses in different group entities with harmonized methodology and consolidated results.
• Regulatory mapping: Systematic mapping of different national regulatory requirements to identify commonalities and specific local requirements.
• Group-level implementation planning: Development of a coordinated implementation plan that considers both group-wide standards and local requirements.

💡 Specific Added Value for International Groups:
• Efficiency through standardization: Identification of potentials for standardization of compliance processes across group entities.
• Best practice transfer: Facilitation of knowledge and best practice transfer between different group entities.
• Consolidated reporting: Development of consolidated reporting structures for group-wide compliance monitoring.
• Regulatory dialogue support: Support in communication with different national supervisory authorities.`
