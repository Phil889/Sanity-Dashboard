    question: 'How can financial institutions use MiFID II compliance as a strategic advantage and what approach does ADVISORI pursue?',
    answer: `MiFID II is often perceived as a regulatory burden, yet forward-thinking financial institutions transform these requirements into strategic advantages. The regulation ultimately aims for greater transparency, better investor protection, and more efficient markets – values that should also form the core of a customer-oriented business model. ADVISORI supports you in using compliance not as a mere obligation, but as a catalyst for sustainable growth.

🔍 Strategic Levers of MiFID II for Your Institution:
• Differentiation through Transparency: Use transparency requirements as a competitive advantage by creating a superior customer experience with complete cost transparency and understandable product information.
• Product Portfolio Optimization: Product governance requirements provide a structured framework to rationalize your product offering, eliminate unprofitable or unsuitable products, and focus resources on your core competencies.
• Data-Driven Customer Service: The extensive data from MiFID II processes (suitability assessments, target market definitions, transaction reporting) can be transformed into valuable customer insights that improve your advisory quality and cross-selling opportunities.
• Technological Modernization: The complexity of requirements can serve as a catalyst for overdue IT modernizations that bring long-term efficiency gains and cost savings.

🛠️ The ADVISORI Approach for Strategic MiFID II Implementation:

• Customer Journey Mapping: Analysis and redesign of customer interactions considering MiFID II requirements to minimize friction and improve customer experiences.
