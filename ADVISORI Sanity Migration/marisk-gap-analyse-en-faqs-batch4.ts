    question: 'How does ADVISORI integrate a MaRisk gap analysis into overarching GRC strategies (Governance, Risk, Compliance) and thus create sustainable synergies?',
    answer: `The isolated consideration of MaRisk compliance without integration into an overarching GRC strategy often leads to redundancies, inconsistencies and increased resource expenditure. ADVISORI pursues an integrated approach that embeds MaRisk requirements in a holistic GRC context and thus creates sustainable synergies.

🔄 Integration into Overarching GRC Frameworks:
• Harmonized control landscape: Identification of control overlaps between MaRisk and other regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, BAIT) and development of integrated control mechanisms.
• Consolidated risk taxonomy: Establishment of a uniform risk taxonomy that encompasses both MaRisk-specific and other risk categories, thus creating a consistent risk understanding.
• Integrated governance structures: Analysis and optimization of governance structures to ensure efficient coverage of all regulatory requirements through clear responsibilities.
• Technology-enabled GRC: Identification of synergy potentials through the use of integrated GRC platforms for documentation, control and reporting.

📊 Synergy Effects of an Integrated Gap Analysis:
• Efficiency increase through avoided duplication: Reduction of total compliance costs through elimination of redundant processes and controls.
• Improved consistency and risk coverage: Avoidance of control and responsibility gaps through an integrated GRC framework.
