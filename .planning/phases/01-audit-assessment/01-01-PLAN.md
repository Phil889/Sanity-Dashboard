<objective>
Inventory and test all existing scripts in the ADVISORI Sanity Migration project.

Purpose: Understand what tooling exists, what's runnable, and what's broken before building anything new.
Output: Complete inventory of scripts with test results documenting working/broken/obsolete status.

  <name>Task 1: Catalog all package.json files, npm scripts, and runnable entry points</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/01-01-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
  1. Find ALL package.json files in the project (excluding node_modules). Read each and document:
     - Location
     - Dependencies listed
     - npm scripts defined (if any)
  2. Find ALL .js and .ts files in `ADVISORI Sanity Migration/` (not in de-pages-created/ or node_modules/). Categorize them:
     - `check-*.ts` files (verification scripts)
     - `create-*-en.ts` files (translation creation scripts)
     - Other utility scripts
  3. Find ALL .ts files in `translation-batch/` directory — document template files vs German JSON sources
  4. Check root directory for any runnable scripts or JSON data files
  5. Count totals per category

  Do NOT modify any files. This is read-only investigation.
  </action>
  <verify>Inventory list covers all .js, .ts files outside node_modules. File counts match what `find` reports.</verify>
  <done>Complete inventory with file paths, categories, and counts for every script in the project</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Test each script category — document what runs, fails, or errors</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/01-01-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
  1. Check if npm/npx/tsx are available in the project:
     - Does `ADVISORI Sanity Migration/de-pages-created/` have node_modules installed?
     - Is ts-node or tsx available for running .ts files?
  2. Attempt to run a representative `check-*.ts` script (pick one that looks safe — read-only query):
     - Run with `npx tsx` from the correct directory
     - Document: does it start? Does it connect to Sanity? What output/errors?
  3. Read (DO NOT RUN) a representative `create-*-en.ts` script:
     - Document its structure: does it import a Sanity client? Does it use hardcoded credentials?
     - What operations does it perform? (create, createOrReplace, patch?)
  4. Check if the translation-batch template files can be parsed (read one, verify TypeScript syntax)
  5. Document results: Working / Broken (with error) / Untested (unsafe to run) / Obsolete

  IMPORTANT: Do NOT run any `create-*.ts` scripts — they write to Sanity production. Only run read-only `check-*.ts` scripts.
  </action>
  <verify>At least 1 check script tested. At least 1 create script read and documented. Translation-batch templates reviewed.</verify>
  <done>Test results table showing script status: working, broken (with error message), or unsafe to test</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All package.json files found and documented
- [ ] All script categories inventoried with counts
- [ ] At least 1 read-only script tested
- [ ] Create scripts documented (structure, not executed)
- [ ] Translation-batch templates reviewed
- [ ] Results captured in SUMMARY.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Complete inventory of all scripts by category
- Test results for representative scripts
- Clear documentation of what's working vs broken
- No production data modified during testing
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
