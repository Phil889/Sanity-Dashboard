<objective>
Synthesize all audit findings into a comprehensive report with prioritized recommendations.

Purpose: Provide a clear picture of the current state and a prioritized action plan that feeds into Phase 2+.
Output: AUDIT-REPORT.md with findings, recommendations, and updated PROJECT.md decisions.

  <name>Task 1: Synthesize findings from all audit plans into AUDIT-REPORT.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/AUDIT-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
  Create `.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/AUDIT-REPORT.md` with these sections:

  1. **Executive Summary** — 3-5 bullet overview of the audit findings
  2. **Current State**
     - Script inventory (from 01-01): what exists, what's working, what's broken
     - Code patterns (from 01-02): how translations are built, redundancies found
     - Translation quality (from 01-03): rule compliance, common issues
     - Sanity status (from 01-03): publication status, tracker accuracy
     - Schema & i18n (from 01-04): document structure, linking mechanism
  3. **What Works** — keep these, build on them
  4. **What's Broken** — fix or replace
  5. **What's Missing** — needed for automation
  6. **What's Redundant** — remove or consolidate
  7. **Recommendations** — prioritized table:
     | Priority | Recommendation | Phase | Effort | Impact |
     Effort: Low/Medium/High
     Impact: Low/Medium/High
  8. **Implications for Roadmap** — any phase adjustments needed based on findings

  Use specific data and examples from the summaries. No vague statements — everything backed by evidence from the audit.
  </action>
  <verify>Report covers all 4 prior plan findings. Every recommendation references specific audit evidence.</verify>
  <done>AUDIT-REPORT.md created with findings, working/broken/missing/redundant analysis, and prioritized recommendations</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update PROJECT.md with audit decisions and adjust roadmap if needed</name>
  <files>.planning/PROJECT.md, .planning/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
  1. Update PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with decisions from the audit:
     - What to keep vs rebuild
     - i18n linking approach confirmed
     - Translation quality assessment
  2. Update PROJECT.md Context section with new findings:
     - Actual Sanity page counts
     - i18n schema details
     - Script status
  3. Update STATE.md:
     - Current Position: Phase 1 complete
     - Last activity: Audit complete
     - Add any blockers/concerns discovered
     - Update progress bar
  4. If audit reveals the roadmap needs adjustment (e.g., a phase is unnecessary or a new phase is needed), document the proposed change in the AUDIT-REPORT.md but do NOT modify ROADMAP.md yet — that's a decision for the user.
  </action>
  <verify>PROJECT.md Key Decisions updated. STATE.md reflects Phase 1 complete. No ROADMAP.md modifications.</verify>
  <done>PROJECT.md and STATE.md updated with audit findings. Any roadmap adjustment proposals documented in AUDIT-REPORT.md.</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] AUDIT-REPORT.md created with all sections
- [ ] Findings reference specific evidence from prior summaries
- [ ] Recommendations prioritized with effort/impact
- [ ] PROJECT.md Key Decisions updated
- [ ] STATE.md updated to reflect Phase 1 status
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Comprehensive audit report that informs all subsequent phases
- Clear picture of what to build on vs rebuild
- PROJECT.md reflects reality (not just initial assumptions)
- Phase 1 marked complete in project state
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-audit-assessment/01-05-SUMMARY.md`
